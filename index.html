                <p class="body-text body-flex">The Croix De Guerre, french for “War Cross”, is an honorable military decoration for distinguished heroes 
                    during the Great War (World War 1). This particular medal for Cher Ami is decorated with an oak leaf cluster. He has 
                    dutifully delivered 12 written messages - a high rate for any war pigeon - when most war pigeons are shot down or injured 
                    during flight.</p>
                <p class="body-text body-flex">While it may surprise you that animals receive medals at all, Cher Ami was given multiple honors.  Cher was 
                    inducted into the Racing Pigeon Hall of Fame on 1931, as well as a gold medal from the Organized Body of American Racing 
                    Pigeon Fancier.</p>
                <p class="body-text body-flex">To this day, Cher Ami is still recognized as a war hero. On November 2019, Cher Ami was one of the first 
                    animals to ever receive the Animals in War & Peace Medal of Bravery, bestowed on Capitol Hill at Washington, DC.
                <p class="body-text body-flex">The myth of Cher Ami continues to be spread around to this day, particularly popular among 
                    school children.</p>
                <p class="body-text body-flex">To this day, scientific endeavors reaches Cher Ami. The 77th Division had dubbed the pigeon as 
                    male despite knowing Cher Ami’s true gender. Recently DNA samples have shown that Cher Ami is indeed male. 
                <p class="body-text body-flex">He has been taxidermied and kept at the Smithsonian institution.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheader flexbig">How homing pigeons find their way back home</h2>
                    <p class="body-text flexbig">There are plenty hypotheses about how these homing pigeons find their ways back home, but it is 
                        currently not very known. Current knowledge points towards two major hypothesis as to why.
                    <p class="body-text flexbig">One hypothesis “magnetoreception”, which allows them to use the magnetic poles of the earth to help 
                        them navigate around. Homing pigeons have these small lumps of metal inside of them that are receptive to magnetic 
                        fields. Through a special kind of magnetic microscope, scientists have attempted to explore more about this theory, 
                        but no solid evidence has emerged yet.</p>
                    <p class="body-text flexbig">The other hypothesis is much less complicated than the former - a vision based model. 
                        Migratory birds, such as homing pigeons, use a “free radical model”. They contain these little proteins found inside 
                        of their eyes that enable to see the magnetic field of the earth. But, like the former theory, there is not a lot of 
                        scientific research to back this theory.</p> 
                    <p class="body-text flexbig">Homing pigeons are sure to use surrounding landmarks to find their way back home. Even with 
                        massive changes to the land, they will be able to find their way back using other landmarks in the area.</p> 
                    <p class="body-text flexbig">What is set in stone, however, is that these migratory birds have two senses to all of them, a
                         map sense and a compass sense. When the trigeminal nerve, found in the beak, is cut, so does their compass sense. 
                         But their map sense is kept in tact, and they are able to find their way back home using landmarks they’ve seen, 
                         albeit not as effectively as they would with their compass sense. If you were to relocate them without their 
                         compass sense, they would not know how to return home. </p>

                <p class="body-text body-flex">On October 3, 1918, the 77th infantry division found themselves behind enemy lines, surrounded and 
                    trapped by German foes. To make things worse, their own forces had been firing upon them, their own forces, under much 
                    confusion.</p>
                <p class="body-text body-flex">Commander of the 77th Division, Major Charles White Whittlessey, attempted to send out multiple messages to 
                    the confused allied forces, with little luck. Every message runner had been shot down and killed by the Germans.

                    success than his runners. He sent two pigeons, each being shot down. The third and last pigeon available, Cher Ami, carried the 
                    message “Our own artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heavens sake stop it”. </p>
                <p class="body-text body-flex" id="last-cher-info">Despite such tribulations against the 77th Division, also known as the Lost Battalion, survived many 
                    harsh attacks. The Lost Battalion advanced the farthest into enemy territory, and never fought in a campaign that had lost. After 
                    the war, they had another name given to them, the Liberty Patch Division.
