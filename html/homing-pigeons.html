            Currently, there is not enough research to back any solid idea of how homing pigeons (or any migratory bird, for that matter) are capable of finding their way around the world. There aren’t many research studies being funded about these birds in general, but the few that have done some research has not come up with any true conclusive evidence or theories yet. There still continues to be more research done, finding “new possible ways that”

            homing pigeons find their way home. Another recent research theory is via low frequency infrasound, but these theories have about as much basis as any of the other theories presented. 
    There are still many discovries being made about the homing pigeon to this day. In fact, a new research study has presented the idea that homing pigeon’s iron rich neurons (previously thought to aide in magnetic field reading) are actually macrophhages.

            These macrophages are not only found in the beak, but all over their bodies. 
     Though theory after theory comes and is debunked very often, one thing is for sure. These birds have something special that allows them to navigate the world, and that they aren’t just flying blind.

            Scientists have theorized that
            homing pigeons have specialized proteins found in their eyes that allows them to see the magnetic 
            fields on the earth. This is currently thought of as false, as research continues.

            The simplest theory with the most scientific evidence is that homing pigeons simply remember their surroundings. This doesn’t necessarily match up with other extraordinary cases, but this is the simplest one to prove.

            There is evidence that homing pigeons have little chunks of  metal found in their ears. Scientists have thought that these metals allow them to “hear” the earth’s magnetic field, but there are doubts whether there is enough metal to do so.
